OpenSiri
======================================

I love the Siri Service on Apple's new 4S phones!  I want to know what makes
it tick, and how it decides how to respond. 


Goals
-------

* gather Siri questions and responses from actual users
* publish an open dataset of questions and responses for use in making future
  Natural Langauge Procressing (NLP) applications, based on what questions
  people are asking in the Real World
* create a parsimonious, mostly-compatible open interface that answers questions
  like Siri would and does.
* Find the hidden easter eggs in Siri, and suggest places where it can do a
  better job meeting user goals.

Non-Goals
-----------

* Speech recognition.  For purposes of this project, we assume the questions
  are in English text (already transcribed)
